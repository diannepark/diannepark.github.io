## Hi, I'm Dianne Park!
I'm a senior majoring in Information Sciences + Data Science and Statistics. 
I hope to gain a lot from this class!


* I love cute stuffed animals so I added some cute pics and utilized a table

### Notes 
Here are some notes I took from the tutorials video for Quiz 1

```markdown
1. Markdown
2. HTML
3. ETC

Bulleted list (this is markdown)
* eggs
* milk
* cheese

<p> Bulleted list (this is HTML): </p>
<ul>
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>oranges</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>
```

We can see no differences in visualization from the users' point of view, but the developer can experience that markdown is much more convenient than HTML. Of course, there are pros and cons in their ways.
