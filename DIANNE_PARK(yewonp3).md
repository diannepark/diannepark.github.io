### Abstract

Access to education and community safety are foundational aspects of urban development, yet understanding their interplay often remains inaccessible to everyday citizens and policymakers. "MapEdu" is a hypothetical open-source project that seeks to address this gap by providing an interactive data visualization platform that overlays public education data with community safety metrics. While the initial scope is centered on the city of Chicago, the platform is designed to be scalable, adaptable, and inclusive of additional datasets and geographies. This paper outlines the vision, management strategies, technical structure, and open-source principles that guide the development of MapEdu.

### Project Objectives and Vision
The core objective of MapEdu is to empower stakeholders with data-driven insights on the relationship between education infrastructure and public safety. This includes:
* Visualizing Chicago Public Schools in relation to police beat boundaries.
* Assisting city planners and school administrators with resource allocation.
* Supporting families and researchers in evaluating neighborhood dynamics.
The long-term vision of MapEdu is to expand the platform to include additional datasets, such as healthcare access or public transportation, and extend its coverage beyond Chicago to other cities and countries. By doing so, MapEdu aims to become a global resource for understanding urban equity.

### Target User Profiles
MapEdu is designed with four primary user groups in mind:
* City Planners: who require spatially integrated data to make equitable policy decisions.
* School Administrators: who need to understand overlapping jurisdictional zones.
* Parents and Students: seeking insights into neighborhood safety and education quality.
* Researchers: studying correlations between public services and community outcomes.

### Open Source Development Strategy
MapEduâ€™s foundation is built upon widely-used, community-supported open-source tools:
* Data Processing: Python, Pandas, and GeoPandas handle tabular and spatial data integration.
* Visualization: Altair and Bqplot enable interactive, filterable, and scalable data visualizations.
* Front-End Deployment: Streamlit serves as a lightweight framework for deploying the platform.
* Collaboration: GitHub is used for code hosting, version control, and contributor management.
Adopting these tools not only lowers development costs but also aligns the project with open innovation principles.
