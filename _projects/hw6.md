# Homework 6: UFO Sightings Visualizations

This project visualizes UFO sightings data using **Altair** and leverages **Streamlit** for interactivity and embedding. It includes two visualizations:
1. A bar chart showing the distribution of UFO sightings by shape.
2. An interactive geographic map of UFO sightings, highlighting sighting details and durations.
